Insidious: Chapter 2 is a horror thriller movie that follows the story of the Lambert family, who are haunted by evil spirits from a realm called "the Further". The movie is a sequel to the 2010 movie Insidious, and stars Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye, Ty Simpkins, and Barbara Hershey.
 
The movie begins with a flashback to 1986, when Josh Lambert was a child and was tormented by the spirit of an old woman with blood red lipstick. His mother Lorraine summoned a demonologist named Elise Rainier to help him. Elise discovered that Josh had the ability to astral project his spirit out of his body and into the Further, where he encountered the old woman. Elise decided to suppress Josh's ability and erase his memory of the incident for his own safety.
 
Twenty-five years later, Josh and his wife Renai have just survived a terrifying ordeal in their previous house, where their son Dalton was possessed by a demon and Josh had to enter the Further to rescue him. However, they also found out that Josh was not himself when he returned, but was taken over by the old woman's spirit, who killed Elise. The police are investigating Elise's death and suspect Josh of being involved.
 
The Lamberts move into Lorraine's house, hoping to start a new life. However, they soon realize that the old woman's spirit is still with them, and that she is not the only one. They also encounter a woman in a white dress, who is the ghost of Parker Crane, a serial killer who dressed as a woman and called himself "the Bride in Black". Parker was abused by his mother as a child and forced to act like a girl. He later became a patient at an abandoned hospital where Lorraine used to work as a nurse.
 
With the help of Elise's former associates Specs and Tucker, and her old friend Carl, Lorraine tries to find out more about Parker and his connection to Josh. They discover that Parker's mother was also a psychic who could enter the Further, and that she had been manipulating Josh since he was a child. She wanted Josh's body for her son, so that he could continue his killing spree.
 
Josh's family must find a way to stop Parker and his mother from taking over Josh completely and harming them. They must also free Josh's real spirit from the Further, where he is trapped and hunted by the old woman. They must face their fears and confront the evil that lurks in the dark.
